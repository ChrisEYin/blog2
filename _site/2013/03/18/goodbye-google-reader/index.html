              <p>After closing the last work related tab on my browser the other day, I fired up Google Reader to catch up on some news and browse through the latest posts. Ironically, the first thing I saw was this: <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/13/google-kills-google-reader-will-go-offline-on-july-1-2013/">Google Kills Google Reader</a>.</p>

<p>Now while I lament the passing of Google Reader (and there&rsquo;s tons of good stuff on why (<a href="http://blog.calbucci.com/2013/03/google-is-about-to-learn-tough-lesson.html">read here</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25VgNZDQ08">watch here</a>), I&rsquo;m not here to complain. I&rsquo;m fully aware that Google could not care less about how I feel about this.</p>

<p>But, If you&rsquo;re as dependent on your RSS reader as I am, then what matters is finding a replacement.</p>

<p>via <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5990456/google-reader-is-getting-shut-down-here-are-the-best-alternatives">LifeHacker</a> and Twitter</p>

<p>Now while I&rsquo;m typically a pretty cheap guy, Google Reader was used so frequently and was such an important part of my day that I am perfectly happy spending a few dollars to get a good solution.</p>

<p>My ideal requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Web based</p></li>
<li><p>List style feed</p></li>
<li><p>Seamless transfer from Google Reader</p></li>
<li><p>A team that seems they care enough about RSS that they&rsquo;re not just going to up and quit. (God forbid I have to go through this again!)</p></li>
<li><p>Magazine style feed option (I subscribe to a few design feeds, and I like to browse through the images for inspiration from time to time)</p></li>
<li><p>Similar interface (Learn how to use something new? Ridiculous!)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The first one I found was Feedly. A quick search brought it up (they already had a <a href="http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/google-reader/">blog post on it</a>! Impressive), and I was already familiar with Feedly &ndash; I tried it out when I was looking for a free RSS reader on my phone (did I mention I&rsquo;m a cheap bastard?). Turns out it actually works pretty well &ndash; looks better than Google Reader, they can do a list based feed and magazine style, their transfer from Google Reader was nice, plus it was on the web and free. It wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but it checked the boxes.</p>

<p>The other one everyone was raving about on Twitter was Prismatic. So I logged in, created an account, poked around, and left. It looked nice, but I thought they were trying to do a bit too much. While others users might need a place to discover news, I just need something that will take my Google Reader feed. Prismatic gave me too much, and couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to import in my Google Reader account. (to their credit, the founder responded to my complaint immediately and told me how &ndash; it&rsquo;s actually pretty easy). Still, was a bit too much for me and I couldn&rsquo;t replicate the feed to what I needed &ndash; organizing feed list style by folders and viewing by folder/subscription.</p>

<p>MsgBoy just didn&rsquo;t work for me. The Old Reader wasn&rsquo;t allowing any importing (due to to large amounts of traffic). I ended up really liking Feedspot and Netvibes as well (looked and felt just like Google Reader), but Feedly did too, and Feedly looked a bit better.</p>

<p>Now for the paid options &ndash; Newsblur and Reeder. I would love to have paid for Reeder. But I need it to be on the web! So regrettable, had to axe this one as well. And despite all the hype, just really didn&rsquo;t like Newblur&rsquo;s interface.</p>

<p>So, ultimately I&rsquo;m settling for Feedly (for now!) Seems to fit all of the criteria above best, and they have a nice mobile app to top it off. It seems to be the easiest way to continue living in a post Google Reader world.</p>

<p>Damn you, Google. You selfish bastards.</p>
