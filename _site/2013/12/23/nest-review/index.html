              <p>I bought my folks a Nest over break. The question I hear a lot is &ndash; is it worth the ~$300?</p>

<p>TL;DR - Yes. It&rsquo;s good for now, but not perfect. Review below.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/nest.jpg" alt="nest" /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://nest.com/thermostat/life-with-nest-thermostat/">Nest Thermostat</a> is a &lsquo;smart&rsquo; thermostat that learns from your habits to reduce wateful spending. Touting features like auto away (turning heat down automatically when you&rsquo;re out), self learning (setting optimal temperatures itself) and more, it&rsquo;s a pretty compelling buy. And not to mention that it looks awesome.</p>

<p><strong>Validation &amp; Installation</strong></p>

<p>Before you can use the Nest, you have to make sure it&rsquo;s compatible with your house. To find out, you remove the cover of your current thermostat, go to the <a href="https://widgets.nest.com/compatibility/">Nest compatibility site</a> and check a few wires.</p>

<p><img src="/images/nest2.jpg" alt="old-thermostat" /></p>

<p>In my case, I had a W, Rh, Y, G, and another tying Rh to Rc. I emailed them in case (<a href="mailto:photos@nest.com">photos@nest.com</a>) and they were pretty quick (within 6 hours) to respond and confirm.</p>

<p>On the site, I was returned with this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/nest3.png" alt="diagram" /></p>

<p>Was unsure of what to do with the Rh to Rc wire, so I left it off. Discovered later that <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/How-do-I-install-Nest-if-my-old-thermostat-had-a-short-wire-connecting-Rh-and-Rc">it wasn&rsquo;t necessary</a> (aside &ndash; found a fair amount of people with the same question, so would have been helpful to include in setup instructions.</p>

<p><img src="/images/nest4.png" alt="install" /></p>

<p>Installation was pretty straightforward &ndash; turn off the electricity via circuit box, remove old thermostat, screw in Nest plate, plug in wires, and then put the Nest on top of it. 15-20 min.</p>

<p><strong>Setup</strong></p>

<p>Once it&rsquo;s on, configuration was easy &ndash; it takes you through a few setup screens &ndash; name your Nest, set the network, time zone, default temp, etc.</p>

<p>Once this was done, next was to link my phone. Created a Nest account on their <a href="https://home.nest.com/">website</a>, and it auto linked my account to my Nest based on the network. Again, pretty smooth &amp; easy.</p>

<p><strong>Using the Nest</strong></p>

<p>Although everything had been easy up to this point, learning more about using Nest was a bit lacking. Outside of learning by pushing buttons, Nest has a <a href="https://community.nest.com/community/help-with-nest">Community</a> and <a href="http://support.nest.com/thermostat/">Support</a> page on their site. While these pages provided some info, I was still hoping to get into more detail on all their features and how to optimally configure/use it. There&rsquo;s almost nothing useful in the box, and what I <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/An-introduction-to-learning">found</a> on the web wasn&rsquo;t enough for me.</p>

<p>Many of the cool features &ndash; <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/An-introduction-to-learning">Learning</a>, <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/How-does-Auto-Schedule-learn">Scheduling</a>, <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/What-is-Early-On">Early On</a>, <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/How-does-the-Nest-Leaf-work">Leaf</a>, <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/How-to-read-my-Energy-History-on-the-Nest-Learning-Thermostat">Energy Savings</a> and more, are things that develop over time. To learn more, I had to look into a forum or community thread &ndash; it would have been helpful to get information straight from Nest &ndash; list of features, how/when to use X feature, when to check back in to make sure it&rsquo;s being used properly, etc.</p>

<p>If this info is up front and center as opposed to hidden in support, users will better understand what Nest is doing and how to get the most out of it. While I understand the goal of Nest is to &lsquo;set it and forget it&rsquo;, it would have been helpful to spell out the features for users so they don&rsquo;t have to go digging through the the forums to find the answers.</p>

<p><strong>UI/UX</strong></p>

<p>I realize this is a fairly large upgrade from the standard thermostat in terms of aesthetic/usability &ndash; and although the UX is nice, I was a bit disappointed in the UI, both on the device and the apps (<a href="https://home.nest.com/">web</a> &amp; <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id464988855?mt=8">mobile</a>). While you have to take the 2 &frac12; stars and poor reviews with a grain of salt, the apps could definitely use some improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Support</strong></p>

<p>This is the one area that scared me a bit. After initially setting up the Nest, we left town for a day. Upon return, I was excited to turn on the Nest &amp; pre-heat the house remotely &ndash; but the app said the Nest was offline. After getting back and checking &ndash; Nest having trouble connecting to the network because of low battery.</p>

<p>Totally unaware there was even a battery (thought it powered through the wall), I went online to figure out what was going on.</p>

<p><img src="/images/nest5.png" alt="images" /></p>

<p>Found this on the support page and it <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/Intermittent-low-battery-or-connectivity-issues-with-thermostat-software-4-0">lead to this article</a>. With no steps to fix, had to search a bit more and found <a href="http://support.nest.com/article/What-s-the-mini-USB-port-on-the-back-of-the-display-for">this article</a> &ndash; had to recharge Nest through an outlet so we could use &amp; reconnect in the interim (next up was <a href="http://shaunmerrigan.info/site-news/nest-thermostat-battery-charge-problem-and-solution/">this</a> if it didn&rsquo;t work). Let it charge for ~1hr and set it back on the wall. Haven&rsquo;t had a problem since, but the lack of clear steps for a resolution left me a bit uneasy.</p>

<p>While perusing the support pages during this time, I found a few frustrated people with Nest&rsquo;s seemingly lack of care for support issues. With only a support email alias and no direct number, I can see why. While email only support is fairly common for startups, not sure if this is a good approach for home consumer products.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;ve had a good experience with Nest and would generally recommend it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear the Nest guys spent a lot of time building a beautiful product. However, the experience as a whole feels incomplete.</p>

<p>The aesthetics and functionality of the product are amazing and undoubtedly a step up from a traditional thermostat. But as for continuing to support and help users maximize usage of the product after installation, Nest could use some improvement.</p>

<p>By simply adding a detailed user manual so users know how they&rsquo;re benefitting from Nest&rsquo;s features and providing a better support site or line, they could dramatically improve the overall experience. Otherwise, Nest runs the risk of being perceived as an expensive remote control for your thermostat.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re into new toys and want to upgrade &ndash; Nest is perfect for you. But I think for now, Nest will remain an expensive toy in consumers' eyes until it has spent more time in the market proving that it is worth the cost.</p>
