              <blockquote><p>When you are hunting elephants, don&rsquo;t get distracted chasing rabbits.</p></blockquote>

<p>  -<em>T. Boone Pickens</em></p>

<p>For years I&rsquo;ve been a big inbox zero guy. I rigorously maintained all of my inboxes and other web services (pocket, feedly, evernote, etc.)</p>

<p>To me, if you didn&rsquo;t manage your online services, they were useless. Then they were toys &ndash; fun to play with, but don&rsquo;t provide any real utility.</p>

<p>At the time, I was getting a fair amount of emails and I was able to manage. Since I started at Coupa, it shot up at least 3 fold and I was drowning in a deluge of emails. I couldn&rsquo;t keep up. I needed a new system.</p>

<hr>


<p>I was listening to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqUG2_cmZ6I">PandoMonthly with Chris Sacca</a> (embedded below). An awesome talk all around &ndash; but the point that that stood out to me was the notion of offense vs. defense.</p>

<p>Take an email inbox. An inbox is really just a <a href="https://twitter.com/shellen/status/228202415789334528">public todo list</a> that anybody can put things on. You can easily spend all day ticking off your emails and it&rsquo;s easy to feel accomplished and like you&rsquo;re getting a lot done.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s a false sense of accomplishment. By spending your efforts checking off tasks that anyone can give you, there&rsquo;s no coherence around your tasks. You keep working aimlessly and doing everyone&rsquo;s else&rsquo;s bidding but your own. It&rsquo;s the ultimate exercise in feeling busy, but not actually doing anything.</p>

<hr>


<p>Prior, I was always impeccable at getting my emails done. I always emailed back. I always followed up at least 3 times. The more useless emails that I responded to, the more useless work came into my life. I didn&rsquo;t realize any of this at the time &ndash; I felt like I was getting shit done.</p>

<p>As it fell apart with the addition of Coupa emails, I started trying to figure out a new way to manage all my emails.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when I watched the video below and it opened my eyes to what I was actually doing. I felt accomplished, but I was really just keeping busy doing work for other people. I was only making marginal &ndash; if any &ndash; progress on my own goals. That&rsquo;s why every time I turned off my email and worked in a dark corner, I felt extremely productive. Otherwise I always felt like I was getting stuff done, but I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was doing anything or making any progress.</p>

<p>So I realized that in order to make real progress, I had to give up on the ridiculous notion of inbox zero. I took a step back, planned out some goals, milestones, and got to work. The endless slew of inbound emails were ignored unless they fit in with my set goals.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s been incredibly cathartic. Yes, my inbox is exploding, but I&rsquo;m making real, tangible progress on the different goals I&rsquo;ve set. I&rsquo;ve been able to make more progress than before, find more free time, and everything else in my inbox is still going on perfectly fine without my response. Amazing.</p>

<hr>


<p>This thought expands further than simply managing email. It&rsquo;s a principle to remember in any situation &ndash; make sure you&rsquo;re always playing offense. There are endless amounts of noise in the world trying to distract you. It can feel productive to work on clearing the noise, but it&rsquo;s a waste of effort &ndash; and a futile one. The only way to truly advance on what&rsquo;s important is to ignore the noise, buckle down, and push your goals to completion.</p>
