              <p>Stumbled across this a few days ago. Really good stuff, so wanted to re-post it.</p>

<p>1.Know what you want. Clarity is power. And vague goals promote vague results.</p>

<p>2.Remember that every problem has a solution. Maybe you just can’t see it. Yet.</p>

<p>3.In this Age of Dramatic Distraction, the performer who focuses the best wins the most.</p>

<p>4.Before someone will help you, you need to help them.</p>

<p>5.Become the most passionate person you know. It’ll be contagious.</p>

<p>6.Know more about your craft/the work you do than anyone who has ever done the work you do…in the history of the world.</p>

<p>7.Join The 5 am Club. Your most valuable hours are 5am-8am. They have the least interruptions.</p>

<p>8.Devote yourself to learning something new about your field of mastery every day. Success belongs to the relentless learners. Because as you know more, you can achieve more.</p>

<p>9.Remember that when you transform your fitness, you’ll transform your business.</p>

<p>10.Don’t check your mobile when you’re meeting with another person. It’s rude. And rude people don’t reach world-class.</p>

<p>11.Every time you do what scares you, you take back the power that you gave to the thing that scared you. And so you become more powerful.</p>

<p>12.A problem is only a problem if you make the choice to see it as a problem.</p>

<p>13.Stop being a victim. Your business and personal life was made by you. No one else is responsible. To make it better, make better choices. And new decisions.</p>

<p>14.You can lead without a title. Don’t wait to get a position to stand for excellence, peak quality and overdelivery on every expectation.</p>

<p>15.Find your own style. Be an original. Every superstar differentiated themselves from The Herd. And marched to their own drumbeat.</p>

<p>16.Understand that when you play small with your success, you betray your potential. And the birthright you were born under.</p>

<p>17.Eat less food and you’ll get more done.</p>

<p>18.As you become more successful, stay really really hungry. Nothing fails like success. Because when you’re successful, it’s easy to stop outlearning+outOverDelivering+outthinking and outexecuting everyone around you. (Success is Beautiful. And dangerous).</p>

<p>19.If you’re not overprepared, you’re underprepared.</p>

<p>20.The only level of great manners to play at is “Exceedingly Polite”. In our world, this alone will make you a standout. And differentiate you in your marketplace.</p>

<p>21.Remember that the moment you think you’re a Master, you lose your Mastery. And the minute you think you know everything, you know nothing.</p>

<p>22.To double your results, double your level of execution.</p>

<p>23.Invest in your personal and pro development. All superstars do.</p>

<p>24.Get this year’s best Targets of Opportunity down onto a 1 Page Plan. Then review it every morning while the rest of the world sleeps.</p>

<p>25.You don’t get lucky. You create lucky.</p>

<p>26.When you push through a difficult project, you don’t get to the other side. You reach The Next Level.</p>

<p>27.Smile. And remember to inform your face.</p>

<p>28.Spend time in solitude every day. Your best ideas live there.</p>

<p>29.Debrief on how you lived out your day every night in a journal. This will not only record your personal history, it will make you uber-clear on what you’re doing right and what needs to be improved.</p>

<p>30.If your not being criticized a lot, you’re not doing very much. Ridicule is the price of ambition.</p>

<p>31.Develop a monomaniacal focus on just a few things. The secret to productivity is simplicity.</p>

<p>32.To get the results very few people have, be strong enough to do what very few people are willing to do.</p>

<p>33.Rest. Recover. It’ll make you stronger.</p>

<p>34.Buy a smaller TV and build a larger library.</p>

<p>35.Remember that the bigger the goal, the stronger a person you must become to achieve that goal. So goal-achieving is a superb practice for character-building.</p>

<p>36.Food fuels your body. Learning feeds your mind.</p>

<p>37.Don’t ask for respect. Earn it.</p>

<p>38.Finish what you start. And always end strong.</p>

<p>39.Breathe.</p>

<p>40.In business, don’t play to survive. Play to win.</p>

<p>41.Protect your good name. It’s your best asset.</p>

<p>42.Remember that words have power. Use the language of leadership versus the vocabulary of a victim.</p>

<p>43.Give more than you take. The marketplace rewards generosity.</p>

<p>44.Know that if it’s not messy, you’re not making progress.</p>

<p>45.Be a hero to a kid.</p>

<p>46.In business, aim for iconic. Go for legendary. Make history by how awesome you are at what you do.</p>

<p>47.Please don’t confuse activity with productivity. Many many people are simply busy being busy.</p>

<p>48.Your doubts are liars. Your fears are traitors. Stop buying the goods they are attempting to sell you.</p>

<p>49.The best anti-aging remedy in the world is working really hard.</p>

<p>50.World-Class performers have no plan B. Failure just isn’t an option.</p>

<p>51.You have the power to change the world—one brave act and one person at a time. Please use it.</p>
