              <p>Recently got some higher end headphones as a gift. While they were awesome, I wanted to make sure I was getting my money&rsquo;s worth, so I looked around. Here&rsquo;s what I found.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been super big on headphones, so this was my first real pass at something nice. For the last few years, I&rsquo;ve just been using whatever headphones came with my cell phone &ndash; most recently the iPhone 5 in ear headphones.</p>

<p><img src="/images/iphone.jpg" alt="iphone5" /></p>

<p>As I started to get into it, I realized I had no idea what I was reading about. Circumaural vs supraural, noise cancelling vs noise isolation &ndash; all meaningless to me. So I read a bit. <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/which-headphones-should-i-get/">Wirecutter has a great overview</a> on the space, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones#Types">Wikipedia</a> is always good too.</p>

<p><strong>Use Case &amp; Criteria</strong></p>

<p>My main use for headphones for work. Calls, blocking others out, trying to focus on what&rsquo;s on hand, etc. From what I read, I knew I didn&rsquo;t want another set of in ear headphones &ndash; I already had Apple for that. And supra-aural was no good, I had a pair a few years ago and they were uncomfortable. Was unsure about noise cancelling vs noise isolation.</p>

<p>So came up with this list of things that were important to me &ndash;</p>

<p><em>Blocks Noise</em></p>

<p>As someone who travels and works remotely fairly often, I find myself frequently working in noisy places. Lots of coffee shops, airports, and even when I am in the office/at home, lots of people on calls. It can be super distracting and really suck. Apple in ear headphones do not suffice.</p>

<p><em>Comfort</em></p>

<p>As mentioned above, I got a pair of supra-aural <a href="http://amzn.to/1fc0DB5">Grado Labs SR60i</a> headphones a few years back (gift) &ndash; and while the quality of music was amazing, they were not that comfortable. I found after wearing for a few hours, my ears would start to ache. Given the long amounts of time I have my headphones in, comfort was an important factor.</p>

<p><em>Phone</em></p>

<p>Needs a mic on it. I&rsquo;m on calls for a large part of the day, and being able to quickly answer calls without taking my headphones off is crucial.</p>

<p><em>Portable</em></p>

<p>I travel and move around from place to place a lot. Needs to be easy to bring around places.</p>

<p><em>Sound Quality</em></p>

<p>Obviously, should needs to be good.</p>

<p>I read a fair amount of reviews and guides on a variety of publications and product reviews on Amazon. The best article I found was this &ndash; <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-300ish-headphone/">Wirecutter&rsquo;s Best $300 Over Ear Headphones</a>. Went to try a few of these out.</p>

<p>One note &ndash; There are 2 types of noise reducing headphones &ndash; noise isolation and noise cancellation. Noise isolation means the headphones just cover your ears. Active noise cancellation headphones means there&rsquo;s a mic that listens to external noise and actively tries to cancel it. For noise cancelling headphones, you typically have a battery and a switch to turn on the noise cancellation.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1fc1H80">Sennheiser Momentum</a></strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/sennheiser.jpg" alt="momentum" /></p>

<p>One of the most acclaimed headphones I found were the Sennheiser Momentums. The reviews were great, and they look amazing. No active noise reduction. All around glowing reviews &ndash; the only real concern voiced online was that they weren&rsquo;t very comfortable.</p>

<p>Listening to music in these were an absolute delight. The quality of sound was great. But while the sound quality was every bit as good as the reviews mentioned, the comfort issues were equally accurate. They earpads didn&rsquo;t fit over my entire ear, and the headphones felt small on my head. It was immediately apparent that wearing these for long durations of time would be a challenge.</p>

<p>Price: $299</p>

<p>My take: Sound quality is awesome. The look and feel of the product is even better. But the dealbreaker is comfort &ndash; wearing these for long periods of time wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1fc2rKk">PSB M4U2</a></strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/psb.jpg" alt="psb" /></p>

<p>These were Wirecutter&rsquo;s winner for best pair for $300. Active noise cancellation, and people praised the quality of sound. What was awesome was that you could use the headphones without turning noise cancellation on (unlike some others).</p>

<p>Without noise cancelling, the headphones sounded nice. With noise cancelling on, they sounded great. The noise cancelling let you focus on the quality of the sound, which was amazing. Also, there&rsquo;s lots of padding so they&rsquo;re very comfortable.</p>

<p>But they are big and heavy. You can definitely feel the extra weight on your head, and they take up a lot of space.</p>

<p>Price: $299</p>

<p>My take: While the sound quality was great, the headphones were far too heavy.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1cXfGLs">Bowers &amp; Wilkins P7</a></strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/bowers.jpg" alt="bowers" /></p>

<p>These headphones look a bit different from what I&rsquo;m used to, and I put them on with a bit of bias.</p>

<p>But they are surprisingly comfortable. They fit over the entire ear, and they feel solid.</p>

<p>However, I wasn&rsquo;t super impressed with the sound quality. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t bad, but I like the PSB M4U2&rsquo;s and Sennheiser Momentum better. These also weren&rsquo;t noise cancelling, and I was trying them out in a noisy environment &ndash; I could hear pretty much everybody. Quickly scratched this from the list.</p>

<p>Price: $399</p>

<p>My take: Expensive, looks a bit too special for me, and not as good as others in relation to sound quality or noise reduction.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1duompf">Audio Technica ATH-ANC9 Quietpoint</a></strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/audiotechnica.jpg" alt="quietpoint" /></p>

<p>Audio Technica headphones in general are very well regarded, and the general sentiment is that Audio Technica makes great headphones at a great prices. These in particular had active noise cancellation.</p>

<p>When you put these on, you&rsquo;ll notice immediately how little you notice. They&rsquo;re really light and by far the most comfortable I had tried up to this point. The noise cancellation worked well &ndash; you could also use the headphones with or without it turned on, which was really nice. Sound quality was nice &ndash; on par or only slightly inferior to Momentum or M4U2.</p>

<p>Price: $285</p>

<p>My take: Sound quality good and comparable to others. Noise cancellation better than PSB&rsquo;s, and much more comfortable.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1lO5KFa">Bose QC15</a></strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/bose.jpg" alt="bose" /></p>

<p>My sister has these, so I did try &amp; use these more extensively than the others. When I switched them on, I was amazed. These were incredibly good at cancelling out sound &ndash; proved when I was writing this post and I had absolutely no idea there was a group of people talking behind me. Also really light and comfortable.</p>

<p>But as the Bose haters will note, the sound quality is a bit below average relative to the others. Also, these headphones only work when noise cancellation is turned on &ndash; so if your battery&rsquo;s dead, can&rsquo;t use them. Which sucks.</p>

<p>Price: $299</p>

<p>My take: What these lack in sound quality is made up with amazing noise cancellation and comfort.</p>

<hr>


<p>Winner: Bose QC15</p>

<p>When it came down to it, noise cancellation and comfort trumped sound quality. The Bose headphones, despite the inferior sound quality relative to the others in this list, were by far the most comfortable comfortable its noise cancellation was far better than anything else. Also has a mic to make calls!</p>

<p>For someone like me &ndash; frequently on the go and working in noisy environments, Bose is the way to go. Else, if you&rsquo;re buying headphones to really enjoy music in a quiet environment, I would go with something else - either the Sennheiser Momentum or PSB M4U2.</p>
